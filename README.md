# BREST-CANCER-PREDICTION
Designed and implemented a predictive model using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn, integrated with a Node.js-based frontend. The system processes tumor data (e.g., cell size, shape, and nuclei characteristics) to classify cases as benign or malignant, aiding in early detection and clinical decision-making.
